# Adam TAGUIROV

## Cybersecurity engineer

I’m a cybersecurity engineer with a strong focus on anti-cybercrime expertise, reverse engineering, vulnerability research, and exploitation. I also enjoy low-level development and building practical tools for the community.

I previously served as president of **Root-Me**, a leading cybersecurity learning platform in France. While I’m no longer active in the team, I hold an **honorary status** in recognition of my contributions.

Everything I publish is meant for **educational purposes** or **community use** only.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: Never use my tools or code for malicious purposes.
