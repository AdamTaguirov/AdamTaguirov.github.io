# Adam TAGUIROV
## Ingénieur en sécurité informatique

I am a security researcher and I like reverse engineering, vulnerability research, and exploitation.

I like low-level development and making useful tools.

On my repository you will find a lot of school projects and you might find some public tools I've written.

Please never use the tools or code I publish for malicious purposes. Everything I make is either for **educational purposes** or **community oriented**.

If you want to contact me you can write an e-mail at: adam@taguirov.com.

I am **not** open for job opportunities for now.
